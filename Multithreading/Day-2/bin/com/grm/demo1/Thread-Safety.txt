Thread-Safety:--

The concept of avoiding multiple threads acting upon the same functionality simultaneously is known as Thread- 
safety.

If multiple threads are trying to operate simultaneously on the same functionality then there may be a chance of data 
inconsistency problem.

Concurrency issue lead to the race-condition. and race-condition lead to the data inconsistency.

Race-condition:--

Java is a multi-threaded programming language and there is a higher risk to occur race conditions. Because the 
same resource may be accessed by multiple threads at the same time and may change the data.

For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data. 
This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error

To solve the data inconsistency problem in java synchronized keyword is used.

So the thread-safety is achieved and race condition is avoided by the help of synchronized keyword.
